## Verdict (one line)

| Use | Probability it “works” in our universe |
|-----|----------------------------------------|
| Elegant **mathematical analogy** (map equations across domains) | **High / useful** |
| Real **mechanism** that forces a single photon into a sub-diffraction core with certainty, or bypasses Born / band-limit / thermo | **0%** |

The reason the physical probability is zero is not “we haven’t optimized the geometry enough.”  
It is that **the laws themselves shield the mechanism** against that abuse.

---

## Barrier 1 — Born rule (\(P=|\psi|^2\))

**Attempted move:** Geometric / tesseract / “quantum mirror” phase forces the photon into one point with 100% certainty.

**Shield:** Unitary / \(L^2\)-norm conservation of the mode; detection probabilities are the normalized density.

**Why it fails in reality:** Superoscillatory designs that beat the naive scale in a small core dump almost all norm into side lobes. The repo demo shows the trend explicitly: as the “target” superoscillation strengthens, \(E_{\mathrm{core}}\) collapses (e.g. toward \(10^{-16}\) and smaller), not toward 1.

**Closed sentence:** A perfect phase for a given band-limited design **already produces** \(\varepsilon:(1-\varepsilon)\) with \(\varepsilon\ll 1\). Perfecting the same phase does not turn Born into a delta at the core.

---

## Barrier 2 — Band limit (\(k_{\max}\))

**Attempted move:** Project 4D / \(B_4\) / 8-cube geometry onto a 2D SLM to carry “more spatial frequency” than ordinary optics.

**Shield:** Wavelength and aperture set a hard spatial-frequency cutoff in free space / the optical system (\(k_{\max}\sim 2\pi/\lambda\) scale, plus pixel pitch of any SLM).

**Why it fails in reality:** No ABCD matrix on paper transmits spatial frequencies the medium and wavelength forbid. An SLM is a **phase screen** with finite pixels; it does not become a hypercube engine without a derived Maxwell map — and even then it remains band-limited.

**Closed sentence:** Band-limit shields maximum resolution; tesseract language does not raise \(k_{\max}\).

---

## Barrier 3 — Stochastic process (OU noise)

**Attempted move:** Treat \(\tau=1/\theta\) as a cosmological “focal length” that focuses a probability envelope of dark energy the way a lens focuses a beam.

**Shield:** Diffusion term \(\sigma\,\mathrm{d}W\) (and, physically, thermal / quantum noise) destroys the phase coherence required for a deterministic “perfect focus” of a stochastic envelope.

**Why it fails as identity:** In the repo, \(\theta\) is a **mean-reversion rate** in \(x=\ln a\), entering residual **covariance**, not a quadratic optical phase on the sky. As analogy, \(\tau\leftrightarrow f\) is optional pedagogy. As physics identity, it is undeclared power. Empirically \(\sigma_X\to 0\); there is no measured “cosmic waist.”

**Closed sentence:** Noise shields perfect focusing of a stochastic field; \(\theta\) is not Descartes’ \(f\).

---

## Unified picture (same moral as cosmology Option 0)

| Domain | “Shield” | Wrong question | Right question |
|--------|----------|----------------|----------------|
| Single-photon super-focus | Born + band-limit | “How do we force 100% core hits?” | “What is \(E_{\mathrm{core}}/E_{\mathrm{tot}}\) for this design?” |
| Tesseract SLM | Maxwell + \(k_{\max}\) | “How many cubes open extra \(k\)?” | “What \(\Phi(x,y)\) implements which ABCD?” |
| Stochastic DE | Small \(\sigma_X\), SDiff on isotropic stress | “Does the vacuum tremble in my pupil / with free phase?” | “What bound on \(\sigma_X\) / which concrete model dies?” |

Nature’s mechanism **blinds** the attempt to **violate** probability, band-limit, or free work.  
It does **not** blind **honest measurements** of amplitudes at the correct operator.

## What we keep

1. **Pedagogy:** Fresnel + thin lens + Born; OU mean-reversion as *structural* analogue of a restoring parameter.  
2. **Numerics:** `superoscillation_energy_cost_demo.py` as evidence of the energy tax.  
3. **Cosmology programme:** limits, model exclusion, Option 0 slip with amplification honesty.

## What we drop

1. Physical tesseract phase cavity as superior to SLM.  
2. Single-photon certainty at a sub-Airy point by phase perfection.  
3. \(f_{\mathrm{cosmo}}\equiv 1/\theta\) as a law of nature.

---

## Final answer to “más por aquí”

Yes: **this** direction — naming the triple shield and closing the 0% / 100% split — is the correct closure of the optics–tesseract branch.  
Next work returns to **correct scale + correct operator** (BAO residuals, concrete models, amplification theory if any), not to more geometry that tries to outrun Born.
