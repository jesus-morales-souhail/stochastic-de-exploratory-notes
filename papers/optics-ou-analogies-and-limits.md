## Q1. Can we derive a “quantum mirror” equation that replaces Descartes for a single photon?

### What is legitimate

In **classical paraxial wave optics**, a thin lens (or quadratic-phase “mirror”) multiplies the field by

\[
M(\mathbf{r}_\perp)=A(\mathbf{r}_\perp)\,\exp\!\left(-i\frac{k}{2f}\,|\mathbf{r}_\perp|^2\right).
\]

Propagating with the Fresnel kernel from object plane \(z=-s_o\) to image plane \(z=s_i\), the quadratic phase at the pupil collects the factor

\[
\Delta R^{-1}\equiv \frac{1}{s_o}+\frac{1}{s_i}-\frac{1}{f}.
\]

When \(\Delta R^{-1}=0\), the pupil phase is flat (to quadratic order) and one recovers the usual **imaging condition of Descartes / thin-lens formula**. The field at the image plane is then essentially the Fourier transform of the aperture (Airy for a circular stop), not a Dirac delta.

For a **single photon in a pure spatial mode**, the detection probability is

\[
P(\mathbf{r},s_i)=|\psi(\mathbf{r},s_i)|^2,
\]

with \(\psi\) the same mode function (Born). So one may write, schematically,

\[
P(\mathbf{r},s_i)=\Big|\mathcal{F}\!\left\{\psi_{\mathrm{in}}\,A\,\exp\!\Big(i\frac{k}{2}\,|\mathbf{r}_\perp|^2\,\Delta R^{-1}\Big)\right\}\Big|^2
\]

(up to known Fresnel prefactors and normalizations). This is **not** a new law of physics: it is Fresnel + quadratic lens + Born.

### What does *not* replace Descartes

| Claim | Verdict |
|-------|---------|
| Descartes fails for one photon | **No.** The imaging condition \(\Delta R^{-1}=0\) still marks the plane of best focus of the **mode**. |
| Probability concentrates to a point when \(\Delta R^{-1}=0\) | **No.** Focused mode still has finite Airy / diffraction size set by \(A\) and \(\lambda\). |
| “Perfect phase” forces detection at the geometric image point | **No.** Born uses the full \(|\psi|^2\); side lobes remain. |

**Answer to Q1:** Yes to a **careful** single-photon *mode* statement:  
**Descartes remains the condition \(\Delta R^{-1}=0\) for quadratic phase cancellation; probability is \(|\psi|^2\) after Fresnel propagation.**  
No to replacing Descartes with a formula that gives a deterministic sub-diffraction hit for one photon.

## Q2. How does a tesseract projection become an ABCD matrix on an SLM?

### What is legitimate

- Ray optics in the paraxial regime: **ABCD** (or 4×4 for \(x,\theta_x,y,\theta_y\)) is standard and symplectic.
- An ideal thin lens is \(A=D=1\), \(B=0\), \(C=-1/f\).
- A **phase-only SLM** implements approximately a pure phase \(\Phi(x,y)\), i.e. a position-dependent optical path — locally like a thin element of type “\(C\)-only” (plus possible pixelation and \(2\pi\) wraps).
- Any smooth quadratic \(\Phi\) can be read as a combination of focus / astigmatism / tilt; higher-order holograms can approximate more general transfers **within the limits of a 2D phase screen**.

### What is **not** derived

The proposed map

\[
M_{\mathrm{tesseract}}=\begin{pmatrix}A&B\\C&D\end{pmatrix}
\quad\text{with}\quad
A=\cos\phi_w\,I,\;
B\propto d_w\sin\phi_w\,R(\theta),\;\ldots
\]

and

\[
\Phi_{\mathrm{SLM}}\propto (x^2\cos\phi_w+y^2\sin\phi_w)+\gamma_4\,\mathrm{atan2}(y,x)\,\ln(r^2/r_0^2)
\]

**asserts** that:

1. SO(4) / Coxeter \(B_4\) / “8 cubes” define \(\phi_w,d_w,f_w,\gamma_4\);  
2. those parameters equal a physical 4D geometry of light;  
3. this exceeds ordinary SLM + pulse shaping.

None of (1)–(3) is derived from Maxwell + a physical tesseract cavity in the text. A 4D hypercube has 8 cubic cells as a **mathematical boundary**; that does **not** automatically supply eight independent optical channels beyond a 2D phase mask.

A **real** SLM programme would be:

1. Choose a target transfer (e.g. focus \(f\), astigmatism, OAM charge \(\ell\)).  
2. Compute \(\Phi(x,y)\) from standard Fourier / Fresnel / GS algorithms.  
3. Measure PSF and \(E_{\mathrm{core}}/E_{\mathrm{total}}\).  

No \(B_4\) required. OAM \(\propto \ell\phi\) is standard and **not** a tesseract theorem.

**Answer to Q2:**  
**You implement quadratic (and higher) phases on an SLM as usual.**  
**You do *not* get a derived “tesseract ABCD” until someone builds Maxwell + device geometry → \(M\).** Until then, treat tesseract language as **undeclared physical power** (same pattern as \(\ln 4 \equiv \omega_R\)).

## Q3. What is the analogue of focal length \(f\) in the stochastic DE repo?

### What \(\theta\) actually is in the repository

Ornstein–Uhlenbeck (Axiom A3 / scripts):

\[
\mathrm{d}X = -\theta\, X\,\mathrm{d}x + \sigma\,\mathrm{d}W_x,
\qquad
x=\ln a,
\]

with stationary variance \(\mathrm{Var}(X)=\sigma^2/(2\theta)\) (when \(\theta>0\)) and correlation

\[
\mathrm{Cov}\big(X(x_i),X(x_j)\big)
=\frac{\sigma^2}{2\theta}\,e^{-\theta|x_i-x_j|}.
\]

Physical reading in the paper: \(\theta\) is an **effective mean-reversion / damping rate** (related to Hubble friction \(3H(1+w)\) in the continuity story), **not** a geometric focal length.

Empirically (DESI DR2 BAO residual MLE): \(\sigma_X\to 0\); \(\theta\) is not a well-measured “focus of the cosmos.”

### Honest analogy table (formal, not identity)

| Property | Thin lens \(f\) | OU \(\tau=1/\theta\) |
|----------|-----------------|----------------------|
| Role | Sets **spatial** quadratic phase curvature of a wavefront | Sets **correlation length in \(x=\ln a\)** (memory / return rate) |
| Limit \(\to\infty\) | Flat phase (no lens) | No mean reversion (Wiener / undamped) |
| Limit \(\to 0\) | Infinite optical power (formal) | Instant snap to mean (if \(\sigma\) fixed, variance formula singular) |
| Observable in repo | — | Enters residual **covariance between BAO bins**, not a PSF on the sky |

One may say, **as a metaphor only**:

\[
\tau \equiv \frac{1}{\theta}
\quad\text{“plays a similar structural role to \(f\)”}
\]

in the sense that both are **single parameters controlling how strongly a quadratic (lens) or linear (OU drift) restoring mechanism curves a profile** (phase vs correlation).

One **must not** say:

\[
f_{\mathrm{cosmo}}\equiv\frac{1}{\theta}
\quad\text{is the cosmological focal length of spacetime}
\]

without a derived map \(\theta \leftrightarrow\) metric curvature / wavefront radius of the universe. That map is **not** in the repo.

### Desqueezing side note

In open-system notes, \(t_{1/2}=\ln 2/\gamma\) with \(\gamma\leftrightarrow\theta H_0\) is a **relaxation time**, again analogous to a rate, not to an optical \(f\) in metres.

**Answer to Q3:**  
The closest **repo parameter** to a “restoring strength” is **\(\theta\)** (or \(\tau=1/\theta\)).  
Call it a **formal analogy** to \(1/f\), not a replacement of Descartes by cosmology.

## Unified verdict (“¿vas por aquí?”)

| Path | Go / stop |
|------|-----------|
| Fresnel + quadratic phase + Born as “quantum thin lens” | **Go** (standard, careful wording) |
| SLM phase masks for focus / astigmatism / OAM | **Go** (engineering) |
| Tesseract / \(B_4\) as superior ABCD engine | **Stop** (not derived) |
| \(\tau=1/\theta\) as poetic “focal length of OU” | **Go only as analogy**, never as optical identity |
| Using that analogy to claim DE “focuses” probability on the sky | **Stop** (wrong operator / undeclared power) |

**Direction for this project:** keep **scale + operator** discipline (BAO residuals, model kills, Option 0 slip with amplitude honesty). Do **not** merge tesseract optics into the DESI/SDiff papers.

## Minimal equations to keep (if writing a pedagogy note)

**Optics (OK):**
\[
\frac{1}{s_o}+\frac{1}{s_i}-\frac{1}{f}=0,\qquad
P=|\psi|^2.
\]

**OU (OK, repo):**
\[
\mathrm{d}X=-\theta X\,\mathrm{d}x+\sigma\,\mathrm{d}W,\qquad
C_{ij}\propto e^{-\theta|x_i-x_j|}.
\]

**Bridge (analogy only):**
\[
f \;\longleftrightarrow\; \frac{1}{\theta}
\quad\text{as “restoring-parameter” roles, not units-equivalent physics.}
\]
